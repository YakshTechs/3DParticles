An interactive **HTML CSS JavaScript** project that transforms text into animated particles which respond to mouse interactions. This showcases creative coding skills, animation handling, and DOM-canvas integration.

🚀 Features
-----------

-   Customizable text and particle colors

-   Smooth particle motion with mouse interaction

-   Fully responsive and lightweight

-   Pure HTML CSS JS with no external libraries

📂 Project Structure
--------------------

```
project/
│── index.html       # Main HTML file
│── style.css        # Styling for layout and text
│── script.js        # Animation logic

```

⚙️ How It Works
---------------

1.  **Canvas Rendering** -- Text is drawn on a hidden canvas to capture pixel data.

2.  **Particle Generation** -- Each pixel is converted into a particle object with its own position and velocity.

3.  **Interaction** -- Mouse movement alters particle positions, creating a ripple-like effect.

4.  **Animation Loop** -- The particles are continuously redrawn using `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth performance.

📦 Installation & Usage
-----------------------

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/YakshTechs/3DParticles.git

    ```

2.  Open `index.html` in your browser.

3.  Move your mouse around and watch the particles react.

🔧 Customization
----------------

-   Change text in `script.js`:

    ```
    const displayText = "YAKSH DEVANI";

    ```

-   Adjust colors in `style.css` or `script.js`.

-   Modify particle size and speed for different effects.

💡 Skills Demonstrated

-   Canvas API manipulation

-   JavaScript animation techniques

-   Event handling for interactivity
